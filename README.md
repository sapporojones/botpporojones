This bot is a discord bot written in python as a way for me to kill time learning python with a project.  

It has several commands, as those commands are subject to change just read the python itself or type !help when it joins a channel.  

Just edit the .env file in the same path as the python script with your apikeys and personal variables so we can keep the python itself sanitized of personal data.
